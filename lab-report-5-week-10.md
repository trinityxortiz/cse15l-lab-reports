# Lab Report 5 (Week 10)   
Updated: 6/5/2022  
## Chosen Tests
- [530](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/530.md)
- [507](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/507.md)

## Finding the Tests  
- First I cloned both my repository and the class repository into the cse15l server. Then I ran `bash script.sh > results.txt` on both repositories to generate output for each implementation and added the output to a text file. Afterwards, I used vimdiff to see the differences of the output.

## Determining the Correct Implementation 

### Test 507
- [] implementation was correct
- [] implementation was not correct because of [this bug]. ![ss of code that should be changed].
- Both actual outputs: ![screenshot of actual output]


### Test 530
- [] implementation was correct.
- [] implementation was not correct because of [this bug].
